          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p align="justify">Hello! My name is Víctor Labrador and I am a cybersecurity expert. My training began with a degree in computer science and once I finished it, after taking several courses related to cybersecurity, I decided to take a master's degree specialized in this field. Currently, I continue doing projects on my own to keep myself updated in such a changing field as cybersecurity.</p>

            <h3>Cyber Intelligence Engineer &amp; Hacking</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic" align="justify">
              I started in this world when I was young, about 14 years old, when I was interested in Wi-Fi networks security. After that, I discovered the wonderful world of Linux and little by little I got into computing. Since then I have worked in my spare time in different tasks related to computing, such as process optimization or cybersecurity, doing things ranging from a program to sort my photos as I like to a crawler capable of extracting information about products from the dark markets in the Darkweb.
              <br><br>
              I have been active in the working world since October 2018 and I have been specializing little by little in cybersecurity, starting as a programmer, continuing as a system administrator, going through cybersecurity analyst and ending in cyber intelligence analyst, which has allowed me to know quite well multiple areas within IT and helps me to have a more global vision when it comes to work.
              <br><br>
              Currently, I am focused on the field of cyberintelligence, both in and out of my job, researching on my own and obtaining different certifications related to this topic.

              <p>Later, from September 2020, at the same time that I was taking the Master in Cybersecurity, I started to participate in all the tasks related to security.</p>
              <p>Some of the tasks I performed in this more hybrid profile between systems administration and cybersecurity included:
              <ul>
                <li>Responsible for vulnerability analysis on a monthly basis.</li>
                <li>Installation, configuration and synchronization of antivirus on all workstations, along with alerts and reports.</li>
                <li>Configuration of the Kibana tool for log management.</li>
                <li>Active participation in internal and external audits (ISO 27001).</li>
                <li>Creation of phishing campaigns to analyze possible employee behavior accompanied by increased awareness.</li>
              </ul>

            Currently, the Dark Web is one key platform for the online trading of illegal products and services. Analysing the .onion sites hosting marketplaces is of interest for law enforcement and security researchers. This paper presents a study on 123k listings obtained from 6 different Dark Web markets. While most of current works leverage existing datasets, these are outdated and might not contain new products, e.g., those related to the 2020 COVID pandemic. Thus, we build a custom focused crawler to collect the data. Being able to conduct analyses on current data is of considerable importance as these marketplaces continue to change and grow, both in terms of products offered and users. Also, there are several anti-crawling mechanisms being improved, making this task more difficult and, consequently, reducing the amount of data obtained in recent years on these marketplaces. We conduct a data analysis evaluating multiple characteristics regarding the products, sellers, and markets. These characteristics include, among others, the number of sales, existing categories in the markets, the origin of the products and the sellers. Our study sheds light on the products and services being offered in these markets nowadays. Moreover, we have conducted a case study on one particular productive and dynamic drug market, i.e., Cannazon. Our initial goal was to understand its evolution over time, analyzing the variation of products in stock and their price longitudinally. We realized, though, that during the period of study the market suffered a DDoS attack which damaged its reputation and affected users' trust on it, which was a potential reason which lead to the subsequent closure of the market by its operators. Consequently, our study provides insights regarding the last days of operation of such a productive market, and showcases the effectiveness of a potential intervention approach by means of disrupting the service and fostering mistrust.</p>

            <p class="description">Nowadays, the number of legal documents processed daily prevents the work from being done manually. One of the most relevant processes is the classification of this kind of documents, not only because of the importance of the task itself, but also since it is the starting point for other important tasks such as data search or information extraction. In spite of technological advances, the task of automatic classification is still performed by specialized staff, which is expensive, time-consuming, and subject to human errors. In the best case it is possible to find systems with statistical approaches whose benefits in terms of efficacy and efficiency are limited. Moreover, the presence of overlapping elements in legal documents, such as stamps or signatures distort the text and hinder these automatic tasks. In this work, we present an approach for performing automatic classification tasks over these legal documents which exploits the semantic properties of word embeddings. We have imp lemented our approach so that it is simple to address different types of documents with little effort. Experimental results with real data show promising results, greatly increasing the productivity of systems based on other approaches.</p>
